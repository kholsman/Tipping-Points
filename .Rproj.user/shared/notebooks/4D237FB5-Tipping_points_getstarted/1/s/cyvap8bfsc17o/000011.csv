################################### WARNING ###################################
# We noticed you have dplyr installed. The dplyr lag() function breaks how    #
# base R's lag() function is supposed to work, which breaks lag(my_xts).      #

# Calls to lag(my_xts) that you enter or source() into this session won't     #
# work correctly.                                                             #

# You can use stats::lag() to make sure you're not using dplyr::lag(), or you #
# can add conflictRules('dplyr', exclude = 'lag') to your .Rprofile to stop   #
